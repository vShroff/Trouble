# Trouble

This is a project that I made in my software engineering class (Fall'2019). This is a 2 player version of the game. 

## A short description of the project
Each player starts in their respective homes. In order for the players to start moving their pegs, they have to wait to roll a 6.

As each player roles the the die, the number that appears on the die is the amount of steps the player has to take.
If a player lands on a spot which is being occupied by another player, the latter will have to go back home and the new player now resides on that spot.

Each player starts with 4 pegs, the first player to reach all the pegs to the finish line wins.
